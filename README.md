# Web app that uses openweathermap.org API to get data about weather in choosen city

### I created the app when i was bored to try working with APIs
### app so old i even kept the apiKey as javascript variable, because i didn't know about the environment variables ðŸ˜…

## To get started with this app just type these commands on your dir's command prompt
## `npm i`
## `npm start`
